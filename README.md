Opensource English-Spanish dictionary, created with ChatGPT. The dictionary is located in "dictionaries" folder in xlsx and JSON formats. 

Includes 59k entries based on top-frequent words from https://www.openslr.org/21/. 

The entries are generated by ChatGPT-3.5, use them responsibly accounting for possible hallucinations!

The dictionary is published under MIT license, i.e. I do not object anyone use it for any kind of purposes. The dictionary now includes ~60k words (less than Oxford Dictionary, more than any open-source alternative) and I am determined to widen the vocabulary in the near future. Each entry consists of:
1. the translated word
2. two example sentences in Spanish
3. their translations to English.
 

The algorithm with which I generated the dictionary is presented in (barely readable, maybe) the notebook in the aforementioned repository and also (for my Russian-speaking followers or those who are tolerant to Google-translated pages) in my article here: https://lnkd.in/dgb6enVU

Please, pay attention that the entries in the dictionary are generated by LLM (namely, ChatGPT-3.5) which means that I DO NOT guarantee their correctness. Metrics show at least 90% of the translations to be correct, but still. If you are planning to use the dictionary for communications in extreme situations -- please, don't. But I think it is still great for MVP's and student projects.
